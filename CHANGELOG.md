## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-11

End-to-end audit pass. A multi-agent deep audit uncovered three more "silently
ignored input" bugs of the same shape as the ones fixed in 1.0.3 and 1.0.4, plus
a cluster of doc-versus-reality drift in the README.

### Fixed
- **`Pool<T>` was silently ignoring `PoolRequest.initializationTiming`**. The
  constructor always prewarmed inline whenever `shouldPrewarm && initialPoolSize > 0`,
  regardless of `Lazy` / `NextFrame` / `OnAwake` / `OnStart` / `OnEvent`. `GameObjectPool`
  honored these correctly. Pool&lt;T&gt; now matches: `Lazy` skips prewarm, `NextFrame`
  defers via coroutine on the PoolingManager singleton (or falls back to immediate if
  the manager isn't available), and the other modes prewarm at construction.
- **`GameObjectPool.Despawn` was skipping `IPoolable.PoolReset()`**. Pool&lt;T&gt;
  invokes PoolReset after deactivating; GameObjectPool only called `OnDespawned`.
  For an IPoolable prefab pooled via the non-generic path (which `PoolingManager.Spawn`
  routes to when the prefab has no IPoolable on the root, or callers via
  `GetOrCreateGameObjectPool`), this silently skipped the configurable base-class
  cleanup — `PoolableMonoBehaviour.resetTransformOnDespawn`,
  `sleepRigidbodiesOnDespawn`, custom `PoolReset` overrides — for every despawn.
- **`PooledVfx.PlayForDuration` was permanently mutating `[SerializeField]` fields**.
  The method overwrote `maxLifetime`, `useMaxLifetime`, and `autoReturnWhenFinished`
  on the live instance, which the pool reuses. Subsequent spawns from the same pool
  inherited the duration from the previous call. Now uses transient runtime fields
  (`_hasDurationOverride`, `_overrideMaxLifetime`) that reset on `OnDespawned`.

### Documentation
- **README API reference cleaned up** — multiple incorrect signatures that would
  compile-fail on copy-paste:
  - `pool.DespawnBatch(objects)` — method doesn't exist; removed.
  - `buffer.SpawnAsync(...)` / `SpawnBatchAsync(...)` — methods don't exist; replaced
    with the correct `EnqueueSpawn` / `EnqueueSpawnBatch` pattern.
  - `PoolingManager.BootstrapPools(...)` — method is private; corrected to
    `AddPreset(request)` + `TriggerBootstrap(eventId)`.
  - `poolControl.CullExcess(maxCount)` — method doesn't exist; corrected to
    `ShrinkInactive(targetInactive)`.
  - `PoolingManager.GetPool(prefab)` — `GetPool` takes a string only; clarified and
    pointed to `TryGetPool(GameObject, out IPool)` for prefab lookup.
  - `PoolingEvents.OnPoolExpanded` — documented arity was 2, real signature is
    `Action<string, int, int>` (poolId, oldSize, newSize); corrected.
  - `PoolingEvents.OnObjectDestroyed` — event doesn't exist; removed.
  - `PoolingEvents.OnObjectSpawned` / `OnObjectDespawned` — only defined when
    `ENABLE_POOL_LOGS` is in scripting defines; documented the compile guard.
  - `Rigidbody.velocity` in the IPoolable Bullet example — Unity 6 renamed to
    `linearVelocity`; updated to match the package's stated Unity 6 support.

### Tests
- New `Tests/PoolBehaviorTests.cs` covering the bug paths from 1.0.2 – 1.0.5:
  request poolId / poolGuid precedence, `usePoolContainer` parenting, GameObjectPool
  cull-on-overflow vs. keep-when-disabled, GameObjectPool with non-IPoolable prefabs,
  `GameObjectPool.Despawn` calling `PoolReset`. Existing test count was zero on the
  actual Pool&lt;T&gt; / GameObjectPool surfaces, which is how 1.0.2 – 1.0.4 shipped
  with regressions.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **`Pool<T>` was silently ignoring `PoolRequest.poolId` and `PoolRequest.poolGuid`**.
  The constructor's poolId resolution was `poolId ?? hash` — only honouring its own
  ctor argument and falling through to an auto-generated hash. `PoolingManager.GetOrCreatePool<T>`
  doesn't pass a ctor poolId, so `request.poolId = "Bullets"` would never reach the
  pool. Subsequent `PoolingManager.GetPool("Bullets")` returned null even though the
  pool clearly existed. Now matches `GameObjectPool`'s precedence chain:
  `request.poolGuid > ctor poolId > request.poolId > auto-hash`.
- **README API reference had several incorrect signatures** that would compile-fail
  on copy-paste:
  - `PoolingManager.Instance.SpawnBatch(...)` doesn't exist — corrected to show
    `SpawnBatch` as the IPoolControl extension method it actually is.
  - `PoolingManager.Instance.CaptureSnapshot()` doesn't exist — corrected to
    `GetSnapshot()`.
  - `PoolRequest.allowExpansion` doesn't exist — corrected to `allowDynamicExpansion`.
  - `PoolRequest.cullThreshold` doesn't exist — removed; behavior is controlled by
    `maxPoolSize` + `cullExcessObjects` together.

### Deprecated
- **`PoolRequest.enableDebugLogging`** marked `[Obsolete]`. The field is currently
  a no-op — `PoolLog` uses the compile-time `ENABLE_POOL_LOGS` define, not this
  per-pool flag. Kept for serialization back-compat; may be wired up to gate
  runtime logging in a future release.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **`PoolRequest.usePoolContainer` / `containerName` were silently ignored** when
  a pool was created through `PoolingManager.GetOrCreatePool<T>` /
  `GetOrCreateGameObjectPool`. The container-creation branch in `Pool<T>` and
  `GameObjectPool` only ran when `poolParent == null`, but `PoolingManager`
  always passed its own `transform` as `poolParent`. Pooled instances landed
  directly under the `PoolingManager` GameObject instead of under a named
  child container. Container is now always created when `usePoolContainer`
  is true and parented under `poolParent` (or scene root if none). Resulting
  hierarchy: `PoolingManager → [containerName] → pooled instances`.

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-11

### Stability & Unity 6 compatibility

This release rolls up bug fixes, Unity 6 API updates, and a major feature (non-`IPoolable`
prefab support) battle-tested in a production project. The previous main branch had two
compilation errors that prevented clean adoption on Unity 6 — both are now resolved.

#### Added
- **`GameObjectPool`** — Non-generic pool that pools any prefab, even without an `IPoolable`
  component. `PoolingManager.Spawn`, `TryBootstrapPool`, and `AddPreset` now fall back to
  this when the prefab has no `IPoolable` (previously this was a logged error and `null`
  return). New public API: `PoolingManager.GetOrCreateGameObjectPool(prefab, request)`.
- **`GameObjectPool.PrewarmSpread(count, frameBudgetMs)`** — Prewarms across multiple frames
  within a per-frame time budget for hitching-free runtime expansion.
- **`IPoolControl.Reseed(bool rePrewarm = true)`** — Flushes and rebuilds a pool. Force-despawns
  every active instance via PooledMarker scan, destroys all inactive instances, then optionally
  re-prewarms to the original `initialPoolSize`. Use after editing the source prefab at runtime
  so existing pooled clones get replaced with fresh ones on the next Spawn — no more game
  restarts to pick up prefab edits.
- **Diagnostics window — per-pool controls** — Clear Inactive / Shrink to 4 / **Reseed** /
  Destroy (with confirmation) buttons on every pool entry. Global toolbar gains Clear All
  Inactive and Cull Unused (60s) actions.

#### Fixed
- **Pool.cs** — Removed reference to undeclared `componentCache` field in `ShrinkInactive`
  that prevented the package from compiling on a fresh import.
- **Tests** — `PoolMetricsTests` and `PoolSnapshotTests` were calling the `PoolMetrics`
  constructor with 9 arguments when it expects 10 (`lastActivityTime` was missing).
- **Pool.cs / GameObjectPool.cs** — Underflow guard on `activeCount`. Double-despawn or
  external destroys no longer drive the counter negative.
- **GameObjectPool.Despawn** — Reject double-despawn early. Without this the same instance
  could be pushed onto `inactivePool` twice and handed out by subsequent `Spawn()` calls.
- **Pool.cs** — `Object.Destroy` instead of `DestroyImmediate` during Play Mode (the editor
  branch was firing in Play Mode too, which can corrupt the inactive stack).
- **PoolableMonoBehaviour subclasses** — `SimplePoolableObject.OnSpawned/OnDespawned` now
  call `base.OnSpawned()`/`base.OnDespawned()` so base-class lifecycle runs.
- **PoolMasterReturnToPool** — `Rigidbody.velocity` → `linearVelocity` for Unity 6
  (`velocity` was renamed and is obsolete in Unity 2023.3+).
- **PoolMasterManager** — `FindObjectOfType` → `FindFirstObjectByType` behind a
  `#if UNITY_2023_1_OR_NEWER` guard.

#### Hardened
- **PoolingManager singleton** — `_destroyed` flag prevents resurrection during
  `OnApplicationQuit`; `Instance` refuses to auto-create in non-Play mode; a
  `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(SubsystemRegistration)]` resets statics on domain reload
  so Enter Play Mode without Domain Reload works correctly.
- **GameObjectPool ctor** — Null-guards `PoolingManager.Instance` before `StartCoroutine`
  on the `NextFrame` prewarm path; falls back to immediate prewarm if the manager has
  already shut down.
- **PoolingManager.AddPreset** — Now validates with `PoolRequest.IsValid()` and dedups
  against both live pools and the pending presets list.
- **PoolingManager.GetAllPoolMetrics / GetSnapshot** — Key results by `PoolId` instead of
  `prefab.name` to avoid collisions when two prefabs share a name.
- **PoolingManager.CullUnusedPools** — Uses `CollectionPool.GetList<>()` with `try/finally`
  instead of `new List<>()` on every call.

#### Internal
- **PoolingDiagnosticsWindow** — Caches `RichBoldLabel` `GUIStyle` (was allocating one per
  row per repaint); hex color codes for active/inactive indicators render consistently
  across editor themes.

#### Examples / Demo
- **Full rewrite**. Old `Examples/` folder (BasicPoolingDemo, BatchSpawningDemo,
  CollectionPoolingDemo, CommandBufferDemo, DemoNavigator, DemoSceneSetup, etc.) deleted
  in favor of a single `DemoBootstrap.cs` plus a minimal `DemoScene.unity`.
- **No external assets** — camera, light, floor, four pool templates, and the entire
  UI Toolkit HUD are built programmatically at `Awake`. No prefabs, materials, UXML, or
  USS to maintain.
- **Always-compiled** — Examples now has `PoolMaster.Examples.asmdef` and compiles the
  moment the package is added. The package-level `samples` entry has been removed so
  there's no manual "Import Sample" step (which would have caused an asmdef name
  collision with the in-package copy).
- **Seven live demo modes** in the HUD:
    - **Basic Spawn** — core `Pool<T>.Spawn`/`Despawn` round-trip
    - **Batch Spawn** — multi-instance grid spawn with auto-recycle of previous grid
    - **Projectiles** — continuous 25 Hz fire stream with lifetime-based auto-despawn
    - **Fireworks** — pooled `ParticleSystem` bursts in 8 different colours via
      per-spawn `MaterialPropertyBlock` (doesn't break GPU instancing); includes a
      "Reseed burst pool" button as a Reseed showcase
    - **GO Pool** — plain cube prefab with NO `IPoolable` component, pooled via
      `PoolingManager.GetOrCreateGameObjectPool` (the v1.0.2 flagship feature)
    - **Stress Test** — burst-spawn 500/1000/2000/5000 cubes into the same pool used
      by Basic Spawn; visceral demonstration that the pool scales linearly with no
      per-spawn allocation
    - **Metrics** — live per-pool active/inactive/reuse-efficiency readout plus
      `CullUnusedPools` / `ClearAllPools` buttons
- **HUD font** — programmatic `PanelSettings` doesn't auto-link a runtime theme, so
  Labels/Buttons render blank backgrounds with no text. Bootstrap now assigns the
  built-in `LegacyRuntime.ttf` to the root via `unityFontDefinition`; UITK cascades it
  to every descendant. Also assigns an empty `ThemeStyleSheet` to silence the
  "No Theme Style Sheet set" warning.
- **GPU warmup** — `WarmupGpuResources` coroutine spawns one instance of each pool
  below the floor for one frame at game start, forcing the D3D12 backend to allocate
  vertex/instance buffers up front. Without this, the first particle burst paid a
  ~60ms `CreateCommittedResourceWithTag` hitch.
- **Particle render flags** — `ShadowCastingMode.Off` + `receiveShadows = false` +
  `reflectionProbeUsage = Off` + `lightProbeUsage = Off` on `ParticleSystemRenderer`,
  and `material.enableInstancing = true`. A ring-of-12 burst (300 particles) is now
  ~3-5× cheaper than before.
- **Compact HUD card** — UI Toolkit panel now caps at 960px max-width, centered,
  with backdrop + border + rounded corners. Sized to content rather than full-screen
  stretch so the 3D scene below isn't unnecessarily covered.
- **URP-first with Standard fallback** — uses `Universal Render Pipeline/Lit` for opaque
  geometry. Particles intentionally use `Sprites/Default` (always available, transparent
  by default, no shader-keyword juggling required).

#### Asmdef cleanup
- **Runtime/PoolMaster.asmdef** — Removed unused references to `Unity.Burst`,
  `Unity.Collections`, `Unity.Jobs`, `Unity.Mathematics`. No source file imported these
  namespaces, so the references only generated "assembly not found" warnings in projects
  that didn't have those packages installed.
